# Ask a Girl Out - Cute Web Project

## About the Project
This is a fun and interactive web project designed to ask someone out in a cute and playful way. The page presents a romantic question: **"Você quer sair comigo?"** ("Do you want to go out with me?").

If the user clicks "Sim" ("Yes"), they are taken to a confirmation page with a happy animation. If they try to click "Não" ("No"), the button moves away, making it impossible to reject the invitation. 😆

## Features
```markdown
- Cute and romantic UI with soft colors and animations.
- Interactive buttons that add an element of fun.
- A playful "No" button that moves when hovered over.
- A transition to a happy confirmation page when "Yes" is selected.
```

## Technologies Used
```markdown
- **HTML**: Structure of the pages.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Button interactions and logic.
